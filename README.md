This code outlines the general steps involved in building and training an AI model for generating personalized travel recommendations:

Data preprocessing: Load and preprocess the training data, including text tokenization, cleaning, and feature extraction.
Model training: Define and train an LSTM-based neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is trained on the preprocessed data to learn to predict personalized travel recommendations based on input text.
Model evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy and generalization capability.
Recommendation generation: Implement a function to use the trained model to generate personalized travel recommendations based on user input text.
Sample usage: Demonstrate how to use the trained model to generate recommendations for a given input text.
Please note that this code is a simplified outline and may require further refinement and customization based on your specific requirements, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and training parameters. Additionally, you'll need to replace placeholders (e.g., "preprocess_input", "decode_prediction") with actual implementations tailored to your dataset and model architecture.

I have also encapsulated the functionality into a class AIPoweredSolution to make it more modular and reusable.
I have also abstracted the data loading and preprocessing, model building, training, and recommendation generation into separate methods within the class.
I ave provided placeholders for methods like preprocess_input and decode_prediction, which you would implement according to the specific requirements of your solution.
You can now create an instance of AIPoweredSolution and use its methods to load data, build and train the model, and generate recommendations for given input text.
You can further extend this class by adding more functionality, such as model evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and saving/loading trained models. Additionally, you can generalize it to handle different types of AI-driven solutions beyond personalized travel recommendations.


HOW TO RUN:
# Example usage
data_path = "data/travel_data.json"
solution = AIPoweredSolution(data_path)
solution.preprocess_data()
solution.build_model()
solution.train_model()
input_text = "I want to plan a trip to Europe in July with a budget of $2000."
recommendation = solution.generate_recommendations(input_text)
print(recommendation)
